I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/core">Center for Operations Research and Econometrics</a>, UCLouvain. 
My research focuses on electricity market design and operations research applied to the Energy system.

I obtained my PhD degree from <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html">UCLouvain</a> with <a href="https://ap-rg.eu/">Anthony Papavasiliou</a>. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the <a href="https://psl.ee.ethz.ch/">Power Systems Laboratory</a> at ETH Zürich. 
I was a visiting student at MIT working with <a href="https://juan-pablo-vielma.github.io/">Juan Pablo Vielma</a> in summer 2017 and a research intern at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/iaravenasolis/">Ignacio Aravena</a> in fall 2019.
