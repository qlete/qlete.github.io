  abstract = {There is currently an intense debate in Europe on the allocation of transmission capacity
    in the internal electricity market. In this context, the concept of market-based re-dispatch has
    regained considerable attention, as a candidate design to reconcile the zonal organization of the
    market with a pricing system that supports efficient real-time dispatch. In this paper, we study
    the problem of capacity expansion under zonal pricing with market-based re-dispatch. We
    propose a formulation of the problem as a mixed linear complementarity problem and analyze
    the existence and efficiency of solutions, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. We
    find that zonal pricing with market-based re-dispatch leads to large efficiency losses. Moreover,
    although there exist theoretical conditions under which the efficiency of the design could be
    improved by means of regulatory interventions, the strictness of these conditions renders their
    practical implementation difficult and, therefore, the full recovery of the efficiency unlikely.}}

  abstract = {In an era of energy transition, it is crucial to ensure that the design of the short-term electricity market provides sufficient cash flows to producers so as to allow the investment of the right technology at the right location. In this paper, we revisit the question of capacity allocation in zonal markets from a long-term perspective. We model the capacity expansion problem in zonal markets in which inter-zonal transmission capacity allocation is organized through flow-based market coupling, which is an approximation of power flow equations in aggregate networks that is employed in European market design. We demonstrate that the classical result of equivalence between centralized and decentralized formulations in transmission-constrained markets ceases to hold in this case. We propose a model of the decentralized capacity expansion problem with flow-based market coupling as a generalized Nash equilibrium that we formulate as a linear complementarity problem. We then perform simulations of the capacity expansion problem with nodal pricing and three variations of zonal pricing on a realistic instance of the Central Western European network and comment on the impacts of flow-based market coupling on investment.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel framework for modeling zonal electricity markets, based on projecting the constraints of the nodal network onto the space of the zonal aggregation of the network. The framework avoids circular definitions and discretionary parameters, which are recurrent in the implementation and study of zonal markets. Using this framework, we model and analyze two zonal market designs currently present in Europe: flow-based market coupling (FBMC) and available-transfer-capacity market coupling (ATCMC). We develop cutting-plane algorithms for simulating FBMC and ATCMC while accounting for \anthony{the} robustness of imports/exports to single element failures, and we conduct numerical simulations of FBMC and ATCMC \anthony{on} a realistic instance of the Central Western European system under the equivalent of 100 years of operating conditions. We find that FBMC and ATCMC are unable to anticipate \anthony{the} congestion of branches interconnecting zones and branches within zones, and that both zonal designs achieve similar overall cost efficiencies (0.01% difference), while a nodal market design largely outperforms both of them (5.09% better than FBMC). These findings raise the question of whether it is worth for more European countries to switch from ATCMC to FBMC, instead of advancing directly towards a nodal market design.},
